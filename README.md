# ProjectG

This is not a decompilation project (yet?), this is a representation of a partial source tree created using PDB files of different releases and files of the game that have been discovered over the years. The actual source files and headers are empty.

The script and file paths used to create the files in this repository can be found in the `.scripts` folder.
